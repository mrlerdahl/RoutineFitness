# RoutineFitness
MSSA class project

## Description
This is a web application that will allow users to have access to a library of various workouts. The users will be able to create weight lifting routines within the application and have the option to share their creation to other users. Users will then be able to search routines made by other users if they don't feel like they have enough knowledge to create their own. Originally this web application was going to have user profiles and journals to keep track of progress and goals, but these features will be implemented later in the project once the main concept is complete.
